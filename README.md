Via modifiable distance and CCD pixel size parameters, use mg_pico.py, PicomotorStandAlone.py, MGListener.py, calibration.py, PortCleanUp.py to control New Focus picomotors through Newport 8742 open loop controller.
Picomotors respond to light source detected by ASI290MM Mini camera and tracked by MetaGuide. Calibration data is saved in corresponding text files. 

Run mg_pico.py to correct. Run calibration.py to calibrate specific system (microlens vs nosecone).

test1.mg contains saved MetaGuide settings
